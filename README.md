# SLAM for HyQReal Quadruped Robot with Velodyne VLP-16

This repository contains the implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for the HyQReal quadruped robot, developed at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT). The robot is equipped with a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR sensor, enabling robust 3D mapping and navigation in complex environments.

## Features

- **3D SLAM**: Uses the Velodyne VLP-16 for real-time 3D mapping.
- **Odometry Integration**: Combines LiDAR-based SLAM with the robot's onboard odometry.
- **ROS Compatibility**: Developed using ROS 1 for easy integration and flexibility.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable to other robots or sensors with minor modifications.
